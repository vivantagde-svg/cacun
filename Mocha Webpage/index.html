    <h1>The Definitive Journey of JavaScript</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. The Pre-JavaScript Era: The Static Web</h2>
        <p>In the early 1990s, the web was a collection of <strong>static</strong> documents. Web pages were written purely in HTML and were non-interactive. If you wanted to submit a form or see new content, the browser had to send a request to the server, which would then generate and send back an entirely new page. This process was slow and clumsy.</p>
        <p>There was a clear and growing need for a language that could run <strong>client-side</strong> (inside the user's browser) to handle simple tasks like form validation or creating dynamic effects without contacting the server.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. The 10-Day Sprint: Birth of a Language</h2>
        <p>In 1995, the dominant browser was <strong>Netscape Navigator</strong>. The company, Netscape Communications, decided they needed this client-side scripting language to stay ahead of competitors like Microsoft.</p>
        <p>They hired a programmer named <strong>Brendan Eich</strong>. He was given an incredibly tight deadline: create a prototype of this new language in just <strong>10 days</strong>. Working under this immense pressure in May 1995, Eich laid the foundation for what would become the world's most popular programming language.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. A Tale of Three Names: Mocha, LiveScript, JavaScript</h2>
        <p>The language's creation was so fast, its name changed several times.</p>
        <!-- Using the original <ul> styling -->
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
            <li><strong>Mocha:</strong> This was the original internal codename chosen by Eich. It had no deep technical meaning, but "coffee-themed" names were trendy in tech at the time (e.g., "Java").</li>
            <li><strong>LiveScript:</strong> When the language first shipped in a beta version of Netscape Navigator 2.0, it was renamed "LiveScript."</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> This was the final, and most confusing, name. In late 1995, Netscape formed a marketing alliance with Sun Microsystems, the creators of the <strong>Java</strong> programming language. Java was the hottest new technology. To capitalize on this hype, Netscape renamed LiveScript to "JavaScript."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This marketing decision caused decades of confusion. To be clear: <strong>JavaScript is NOT Java</strong>. They are two completely different languages with different syntax and purposes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. The Browser Wars and Standardization (ECMAScript)</h2>
        <p>Microsoft saw JavaScript's potential and reverse-engineered it for their own browser, Internet Explorer. They called their implementation <strong>"JScript"</strong>. This created a huge problem: "JScript" and "JavaScript" were not fully compatible. Developers were forced to write "if it's Netscape, do this... if it's IE, do that." This dark period was known as the first <strong>"Browser War"</strong>.</p>
        <p>To solve this fragmentation, Netscape submitted the language to <strong>Ecma International</strong>, a European standards organization. In 1997, Ecma published the first standard, called <strong>ECMAScript</strong> (or ES). "ECMAScript" is the official name of the language specification, while "JavaScript" is the most popular implementation of that standard.</p>
        
        <h3>Early Milestones</h3>
        <pre>
1997: ES1 - The first official standard.
1998: ES2 - Minor editorial changes.
1999: ES3 - The first major update. It added 'try...catch', 'regular expressions', and more. This became the stable baseline for nearly a decade.
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. The Renaissance: ES5 (2009)</h2>
        <p>Work on <strong>ES4</strong> was ambitious, aiming to add classes and modules. However, it proved too complex and politically divisive, and the standard was eventually abandoned in 2008. This led to a "lost decade" (1999-2009) with no major language updates.</p>
        <p>Finally, in 2009, a new, less-controversial standard was released: <strong>ES5</strong>. This was a critical update that modernized the language and made it more robust and secure.</p>
        
        <h3>Key ES5 Enhancements</h3>
        <pre>
"use strict";        // Enables a stricter, more secure mode.
JSON.parse()         // Native support for JSON.
JSON.stringify()
Array.prototype.forEach() // New, helpful array methods.
Array.prototype.map()
Array.prototype.filter()
Object.keys()        // Better object inspection.
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. The Modern Revolution: ES6 (ES2015) and Beyond</h2>
    <p>The 2009 release of <strong>Node.js</strong> (allowing JavaScript on servers) and the rise of complex web apps created massive demand for a more powerful language. In 2015, the community delivered the single biggest update in the language's history: <strong>ES6</strong>, also known as <strong>ES2015</strong>.</p>
     <p>ES2015 fundamentally changed how developers write JavaScript. It also marked a new philosophy: instead of giant updates every 10 years, the committee would now release smaller, annual updates (ES2016, ES2017, etc.).</p>

        <h3>Landmark ES6 (ES2015) Features</h3>
        <pre>
let and const           // Block-scoped variables, replacing 'var'.
() => {}                // Arrow Functions (a new, shorter function syntax).
Classes                 // Syntactic sugar for object-oriented patterns.
Promises                // A new standard for handling asynchronous code.
import / export         // Native modules for organizing code.
Template Literals       // `Hello, ${name}!`
        </pre>

        <h3>ES7 (ES2016) and ES8 (ES2017)</h3>
        <p>As promised, yearly updates followed. You asked about ES7:</p>
        <pre>
// ES7 (ES2016) Features
Array.prototype.includes() // Easily check if an element is in an array.
** // The Exponentiation Operator (e.g., 2 ** 3).

// ES8 (ES2017) Features
async / await            // A huge update that made Promises even easier to use.
Object.values()
Object.entries()
        </pre>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. The Legacy: JavaScript Everywhere</h2>
        <p>From its humble 10-day beginning as a simple browser toy, JavaScript has grown into a global powerhouse. Thanks to <strong>Node.js</strong>, it's no longer confined to the browser. Today, JavaScript is used to build:</p>
        <!-- Using the original <ul> styling -->
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
            <li><strong>Frontend Web Apps:</strong> (React, Angular, Vue)</li>
            <li><strong>Backend Servers:</strong> (Node.js, Express)</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile Apps:</strong> (React Native, NativeScript)</li>
            <li><strong>Desktop Apps:</strong> (Electron)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is the undisputed king of web development and one of the most versatile and in-demand programming languages on the planet.</p>
